	<p>A long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, a group of nerds band together in hopes of finding something new to watch on Netflix.</p>
	
	<p>It was a dark time for the nerds. Although many steroetypes have been destroyed since the 1980's,  This was the galaxy's most terrifying threat since the Death Star.  </p>
	
	<p>This is there story and these are those nerds......</p>
	
	
	<!-- <p>The scrolling titles work well in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Opera doesn't implement 3D transforms yet, but the text will scroll. IE users receive a blank page. A shame, but IE10 should support it.</p>
	
	<p>So how does it work? Well, it's fairly simple. We have an outer absolute DIV (#titles) which is rotated along the X-axis using perspective to give the impression of depth. The same DIV also has an :after psuedo-element which applies a linear gradient so the text appears to fade out.</p>
	
	<p>Inside, we have another absolutely-positioned DIV which contains the text (#titlecontent). The top is set to 100% to ensure it starts off-screen then uses CSS3 animation to move it upward over time. No JavaScript is required.</p>
	
	<p>You will probably need to adjust the movement amount and timing depending on the quantity of text you want to show. The 3D depth can also be tweaked in the #titles declaration.</p>
